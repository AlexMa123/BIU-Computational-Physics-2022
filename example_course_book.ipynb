The object need not exhibit exactly the same structure at all scales, but the same \"type\" of structures must appear on all scales. A plot of the quantity on a log-log graph versus scale then gives a straight line, whose slope is said to be the fractal dimension. The prototypical example for a fractal is the length of a coastline measured with different length rulers.\n",

    "A most important property of fractals is their [self-similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity). Self-similarity means the object looks \"roughly\" the same on any scale. Note the meain difference between regular Euclidean space and fractal geometries: whereas regular space is symmetric under translation, in fractals this symmetry is violated. Instead, fractals possess a new symmetry, called scale invarience.\n",
